[WAFEDA](https://ridwan-adejumo-suleiman.shinyapps.io/WAFEDA/?_ga=2.58495277.663747270.1646329263-556426440.1629003048), sounds weird right. I couldn't come up with a better name. This web app is meant to perform basic exploratory data analysis on browsers courtesy of Rshiny. The app accepts only `csv` and `tsv` files and is able to plot various visualizations depending on the type of variable selected. The app also gives summary statistics and correlations between variables in a given dataset. Souce code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/adejumoridwan/WAFEDA/blob/main/app.R).
