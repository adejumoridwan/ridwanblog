### Adejumo Ridwan Suleiman
**Statistical/Data Analyst**

I hold a Bsc in Statistics and currently pursuing my Masters in Statistics. As an R developer, I love to post contents about the usage of R in statistics and data science which is why I created this blog. My interests lies in data visualization, data mining, business analytics and software development. This blog was built on [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), generated by [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on [`netlify`](https://www.netlify.com/).
