### Adejumo Ridwan Suleiman
**Statistical Consultant || R Developer**

I am the founder of Ridwan Analytics, a statistical consulting firm that offers analysis and statistical software training for undergraduates, MSc/PhD students and researchers.  

I hold a BSc in Statistics and currently a graduate student in Statistics. I am passionate about R, crunching data and numbers and love using statistics to solve real life problems. I have interests in applied and mathematical statistics, data mining, data visualization and business analytics.

My research interests are in probability distribution theory and Bayesian statistics.     

As an R developer, I love to post contents about the usage of R in statistics and data science.

When I am not coding or building advanced statistical models, I am on YouTube blowing off steam watching wildlife videos.
